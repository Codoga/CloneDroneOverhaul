 Important note: This version doesn't have the stuff seen in previous builds. Everything will return in later updates!
 [UPDATE 10.03.23] - I've released version 0.3.0.62 to fix `MissingMethodException` crash on game start

New weapon: Boomerang
- It is a melee and ranged weapon at the same time. To get it, you have to buy specific upgrade, then, to equip it, press Q several times if required.
- "Fire" upgrade: Makes the weapon set every enemy on fire
- "Throw range 1 and 2" upgrades: Makes you throw the boomerang farther than earlier
- "Auto-Targeting" upgrade: (This one may get scrapped in later builds): Boomerang will follow nearest enemy and try to kill it
Note: All boomerang upgrades haven't received own sprites yet

- Level editor changes: Added 6 new objects only for mod
- Soon: Accessories (aka Player outfits) and Weapon skins
- There's early Remastered Arena stuff with enemies remaining counter
- Player movement changes: Now, to do dash, you have to press Shift twice instead of once.
- English localization now uses Piksieli Prst font
- Recoded all mod controllers and UIs to work more _perfectly_
- Recoded mod settings system
- Reduced amount of patches to get rid of lag spikes
- Soon: Overhaul API - This Dll library allows you to add new features to the game easier than before!
